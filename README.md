# Sample Ansible Playbooks
## A repository consisting of various playbooks for oracle linux and ubuntu machines

All ansible playbooks are based on Ansible v2.5.1 which means that all playbooks with work with latest versions of ansible and also with the environments that use older version of Ansible.

Ideally environments must use python3 but in case environments use python2, then you have come to the right place. I have covered 4 different VMs:
- Oracle linux with python2
- Oracle linux with python3
- Ubuntu with python2
- ubuntu with python3

Therefore, you will find two yml files in all directories - one for oracle linux and one for ubuntu.
